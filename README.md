## Conway's Law

    Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure

    _Melvin Conway_

[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) provides the framework for _why_ an orginization needs to align it's organization correctly with it's business values to produce software that _provides_ business value

## The Basal Cost of software

    In my opinion, the development cost of each feature in a product can be divided as follows:

        - The direct development cost of the feature or initial cost.
        - A weekly or monthly cost only associated with the existence of this feature in our system. Making a comparison with the Basal Metabolic Rate of a human body, we can call this second cost the Basal Metabolic Rate of a feature or Basal Cost of a feature.


    The Basal Cost of a feature is composed of two different parts:

        - The direct impact in the team capacity of the added complexity of this feature (new dependencies, more code to understand, more possibilities for bugs to hide, etc).
        - The impact on the cost of the development or evolution of other features due to potential incompatibilities, coupling, etc.

    _Eduardo Ferro Aldama_

The ["Basal Cost"](https://www.eferro.net/2021/02/basal-cost-of-software.html) is an adage to describe the **additional** cost of producing software, beyond software's initial cost
